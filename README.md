# Jw-pyserver

An api server demo, which write in python, and deploy by docker.

### How to deploy

**run in prod mode**

Of course you should install docker engine first.
```
> git clone git@github.com:jaggerwang/jw-pyserver.git && cd jw-pyserver
> ./deploy-prod.sh
```
The deploy script use docker-compose to run all needed containers, including server, mongodb and redis.  
The data and log of server, mongodb and redis will be saved at host's directory "/data/jw-pyserver", which mounted at container's path "/data". You can change the data dir to your own, but the same change should be made to docker-compose file.

**run in dev mode with auto detecting code changing**

```
> git clone git@github.com:jaggerwang/jw-pyserver.git && cd jw-pyserver
> ./deploy.sh
> ./fswatch.sh # fswatch command needed, you can use brew to install it on macOS
```
The data and log of server, mongodb and redis will be saved at host's directory "~/data/projects/jw-pyserver/server", which mounted at container's path "/data". You can change the data dir to your own, but the same change should be made to docker-compose file.

**build image of your own**

```
> cd jw-pyserver
> ./docker-build.sh
```

**create mongodb index**

```
> cd jw-pyserver
> docker-compose -p jw-pyserver exec server ./src/manage.py create-mongodb-index
```
When deploy, it will auto run this command to create mongodb index. So normally you do not need to do this by your own.

### API

The server container exposed port 8888, and it mapped to port 10500 of the host. The domain used by cookie is pyserver.dev(in dev mode) or pyserver.net(in prod mode), Which configured in file "src/pyserver/config/main.py". So you can use domain "http://pyserver.dev:10500" to access the following api in dev mode.
